# Code Challenge // Reverse an Array
Write a function that reverses the order of any array with numbers

## Challenge
Problem domain above. The main challenge was not being allowed to use any built in array methods such as array.reverse, .push, .pop ect. ect. 

## Approach & Efficiency
Immediately I knew that a loop was going to be necessary but moving the last number in the array to the front was the crux of the problem. Ultimately I decided that I needed to create a new empty array and then set the index of that array to i, so that when it looped through it was move down the length of the array. Next I established that the first index of the new array was equal to the last number.
