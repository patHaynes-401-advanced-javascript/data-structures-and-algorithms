# Singly Linked List/ 11-insertions 

## Challenge
Make a mock linked-list. Show that you can make an empty list, that you can insert into the list, the head will point to the first node, you can insert multiple nodes into the list, will return true if value within the list exists, will return false when searching for a value in the list that does not exist, and will return a collection of values that exists in the linked list. 

## Approach & Efficiency
LOTS OF RESEARCH, this one I needed to comb through a ton of information to figure out what a linked list was, what a node was, what a head was ect. ect. From there it was a matter of establishing a node class and a linked list class, and playing off of that.
